# Learning-Java

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects for learning and mastering Java programming. Below is a structured catalog for organizing the projects into different categories based on topic and complexity. The repository also includes a guide for adding new projects to maintain organization and consistency.

---

## Project Catalog

### 1. Basics
Projects focusing on Java fundamentals like syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, and simple functions.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Projects emphasizing OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### 3. Data Structures
Projects implementing data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### 4. Algorithms
Projects that explore algorithms such as sorting, searching, and recursion.

### 5. Advanced Topics
Projects delving into advanced concepts like multithreading, streams, lambdas, and more.

## How to Add a New Project

Follow the steps below to add a new project to the catalog:

1. **Determine the Category:** Identify the appropriate category (e.g., Basics, OOP) for your project.
2. **Create a New Folder:** Add a new folder under the chosen directory with a descriptive project name (e.g., `Project1`).
3. **Add Code Files:** Place all relevant code files in the folder. Ensure the file names are descriptive (e.g., `Main.java`).
4. **Document the Project:** Add a `README.md` file within the project folder. Include the following sections in the README:
    - **Project Title**
    - **Objective**
    - **Technologies Used**
    - **Instructions**
5. **Commit Changes:** Add and commit your changes to the repository. Provide a brief and descriptive commit message.
